* Tool providing a dynamic interaction with (in) the Java
* Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL) for the Javaâ„¢ platform
* Deeply integrated with JDK tool-set
* Also, an API for use within other applications

[NOTE.speaker]
====
REPL::
* Type in a snippet of Java code, see the results

Integration::
*  Stays current and compatible
====

== Why JShell? Why REPL?

* Learning Java
* Experimenting with new libraries
* Rapid prototyping
* Integration with build systems

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* it lowers the initial learning curve of programming.
** REPL gives rapid evaluation of code to young developers
* With a REPL you can just fire it up and play without this overhead.
* Tweak the definition of a class quickly, reset your REPL, and try it again.
* Whole classpath under your fingers
